# Build Your Own React

This project is a step-by-step implementation of a basic React-like library, inspired by Rodrigo Pombo's blog post on building your own React. The goal is to understand how React works under the hood by creating a simplified version of it, covering the fundamental concepts like `createElement`, `render`, `hooks`, and the `fiber` architecture.

This project demonstrates how to build a React-like library from scratch, focusing on key concepts and features of React, including hooks and the fiber architecture. The implementation follows a series of steps, gradually adding features and functionality to our library, named **Didact**.

## Features
- Custom `createElement` function to create elements in JSX syntax.
- A basic `render` function to append elements to the DOM.
- Support for Concurrent Mode using `requestIdleCallback`.
- Implementation of a fiber tree for efficient rendering and updates.
- Reconciliation algorithm for updating and removing DOM nodes.
- Hooks for state management in function components.
